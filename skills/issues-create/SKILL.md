Break a plan into independently-grabbable GitHub issues using vertical slices (tracer bullets).

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a GitHub issue number or URL as an argument, fetch it with `gh issue view <number>` (with comments).

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

`CONTEXT.md` runs automatically when the skill loads — output replaces the line below:

- CONTEXT.md: !`cat CONTEXT.md 2>/dev/null || true`

If content is present above, use its vocabulary in issue titles and descriptions. If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** issues. Each issue is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be **HITL** or **AFK**:
- **HITL** — requires human interaction (architectural decision, design review)
- **AFK** — can be implemented and merged without human interaction

Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

**Vertical slice rules:**
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other slices (if any) must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses (if the source material has them)

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the dependency relationships correct?
- Should any slices be merged or split further?
- Are the correct slices marked as HITL and AFK?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Create the GitHub issues

For each approved slice, create a GitHub issue using `gh issue create`. Use the issue body template below.

Create issues in dependency order (blockers first) so you can reference real issue numbers in the "Blocked by" field.

```markdown
## Parent

#<parent-issue-number> (if the source was a GitHub issue, otherwise omit)

## What to build

A concise description of this vertical slice. Describe the end-to-end behavior, not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Blocked by

- Blocked by #<issue-number> (if any)

Or "None - can start immediately" if no blockers.
```

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.
